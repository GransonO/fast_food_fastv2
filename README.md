# (Reworked)
# fast_food_fast V2
A food delivery web application aimed at testing my understanding of HTML, CSS and Javascript... Languages necessary fro the web development challenges

This is the first of a four part series of tests aimed at gauging the level of understanding and the willingness to understand key concepts necessary for web apps development.

# Necessary Guidelines
### User signup and signin pages.
### A page where a user should be able to order for food.
### A page where the Admin can do the following:
### See a list of orders.
### Accept and decline orders.
### Mark orders as completed.
### A user should be able to see a history of ordered food.
No usage of web frameworks in the project. All ideas born from the root.
